Our approach to building beneficial AI

AI Principles
Our approach to AI is grounded
in these three principles:
## Page 2
We develop AI that assists, empowers, and inspires people in almost every field of
human endeavor; drives economic progress; and improves lives, enables scientific
breakthroughs, and helps address humanity’s biggest challenges. This means:
1   Bold innovation
## •

Developing and deploying models and applications where the likely overall
benefits substantially outweigh the foreseeable risks.
## •

Advancing the frontier of AI research and innovation through rigorous
application of the scientific method, rapid iteration, and open inquiry.
## •

Using AI to accelerate scientific discovery and breakthroughs in areas like
biology, medicine, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
## •

Focusing on solving real world problems, measuring the tangible outcomes of
our work, and making breakthroughs broadly available, enabling humanity to
achieve its most ambitious and beneficial goals.
Our approach to developing and harnessing the potential of AI is grounded in our
founding mission — to organize the world’s information and make it universally
accessible and useful. We believe our approach to AI must be both bold and
responsible. Bold in rapidly innovating and deploying AI in groundbreaking products
used by and benefiting people everywhere, contributing to scientific advances
that deepen our understanding of the world, and helping humanity address its
most pressing challenges and opportunities. And responsible in developing and
deploying AI that addresses both user needs and broader responsibilities, while
safeguarding user safety, security, and privacy.
We approach this work together, by collaborating with a broad range of partners
to make breakthroughs and maximize the broad benefits of AI, while empowering
others to build their own solutions.

Because we understand that AI, as a still-emerging transformative technology,
poses evolving complexities and risks, we pursue AI responsibly throughout the AI
development and deployment lifecycle, from design to testing to deployment to
iteration, learning as AI advances and uses evolve. This means:
## •

Implementing appropriate human oversight, due diligence, and feedback
mechanisms to align with user goals, social responsibility, and widely accepted
principles of international law and human rights.
## •

Investing in industry-leading approaches to advance safety and security
research and benchmarks, pioneering technical solutions to address risks, and
sharing our learnings with the ecosystem.
## •

Employing rigorous design, testing, monitoring, and safeguards to mitigate
unintended or harmful outcomes and avoid unfair bias.
## •

Promoting privacy and security, and respecting intellectual property rights.
We make tools that empower others to harness AI for individual and collective
benefit. This means:
## •

Developing AI as a foundational technology capable of driving creativity,
productivity, and innovation across a wide array of fields, and also as a tool
that enables others to innovate boldly.
## •

Collaborating with researchers across industry and academia to make
breakthroughs in AI, while engaging with governments and civil society to
address challenges that can’t be solved by any single stakeholder.
## •

Fostering and enabling a vibrant ecosystem that empowers others to build
innovative tools and solutions and contribute to progress in the field.
