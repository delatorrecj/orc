## 2. Brand Identity Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0 (Production Build)
**Core Philosophy:** Visualizing Intelligence.

### 2.1 Brand Essence
*   **Name:** ORC
*   **Acronym:** Orchestration. Resilience. Compliance.
*   **Tagline:** "Your Supply Chain. Orchestrated."
*   **Mission:** To decouple the complexity of global trade from human effort, transforming chaotic intake into structured, compliant order.

### 2.2 The "Glass Box" Philosophy
In 2026, trust is the ultimate currency. We do not build "Black Box" AI. We build **"Glass Box"** systems.
*   **Transparency as a Feature:** Users must see *how* the AI thinks.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** We do not replace the human; we elevate them to "Pilot."
*   **Responsible AI:** We align strictly with Google’s AI Principles (Social Benefit, Safety, Accountability).

### 2.3 The "Refined Dark Glassmorphism" 2.0 Style
*   **Borders:** `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` (Subtle, crisp edges).
*   **Shadows:** `0 4px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` (Deep, ambient occlusion).
*   **Texture:** Subtle noise grain on backgrounds to prevent "banding" and add tactile feel.
*   **Assets:** Logo files are located in `favicon_io` (`orc.png`, `orc.svg`).

### 2.4 Typography: The Human-Machine Bridge
We use specific Google Fonts with variable axes.

#### Implementation
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Google+Sans+Flex:opsz,wght@6..144,1..1000&family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&family=JetBrains+Mono:ital,wght@0,100..800;1,100..800&display=swap');

.inter-variable {
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
}

.google-sans-flex-brand {
  font-family: "Google Sans Flex", sans-serif;
  font-variation-settings: "slnt" 0, "wdth" 100, "GRAD" 0, "ROND" 0;
}

.jetbrains-mono-data {
  font-family: "JetBrains Mono", monospace;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
}
```

#### Primary Font (UI & Headers): Inter
*   **Why:** The standard for legibility. Clean, variable weight.
*   **Usage:** Headings, Body Copy, Buttons.
*   **Weights:** Light (300) for large headers, SemiBold (600) for emphasis.

#### Brand Font (Logo & Moments): Google Sans Flex
*   **Why:** Friendly, geometric, aligned with the Google ecosystem.
*   **Usage:** The "ORC" Logo, Hero Headlines.

#### Data Font (The Agents): JetBrains Mono or Roboto Mono
*   **Why:** Monospaced fonts imply precision and code.
*   **Usage:** PO Numbers, Currency, The "Thought Logs" (Agent reasoning), JSON outputs.

### 2.5 Voice & Tone
**Persona:** The "Digital Colleague."
*   Professional, but not stiff.
*   Prescriptive, but not bossy.
*   Transparent. "I flagged this because..." instead of "Error."

### 2.6 Wordmark
*   **ORC** in heavy Google Sans, tracking -2%.
